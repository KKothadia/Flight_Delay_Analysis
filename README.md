  ## Execution Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure the data and pathways match

##Summary of the results

We found certain trends and patterns that indicate that flight delays are most in part due to the origin and destination airport of the particular flight. This could be atrributed to the foot traffic of larger more popular airports, also shorter flights are more likely to be delayed.

##Challenges Faced

During the duration of this project we faced many challenges. The most prominent was our lack of experience in building anything resembling something like this project. Data preproccessing and cleaning also proved to be an obstacle.
